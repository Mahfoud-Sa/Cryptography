# Cryptography Tool

## a Cryptography program that use the different cryptography  algorithms on strings 

using windowd form application I develop a tool that use  different cryptography algorithms on strings 
this project enable you to enter text and then select one of the evaliable algorithme such as:

* Caser
* Monoalphaonicbetic 
* Homophonic
* playfair 
* Rail fence
* etc
and as you probely knew every algorithms has a specific key 
so after you select the algorithms you want the program give the ability to chose the key you need to choise

## how to install it:
you may notice that this an open source c# project so you have two ways to run it
* from the visual studio 
* double Cryptography.exe file that you will fins it in :Cryptography\Cryptography\bin\Debug
